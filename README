Idea
----

To allow people that share the same interests to interact when close to one another.

Overview
--------

1. User informs his interests;
By using hashtags, the user records his interests. These hashtags are stored in a server.

2. When close to other users that share the same interest, he is notified;
The application is running in the background, in a smartphone. The user has GPS, bluetooth, wifi, or any other kind of technology that allows for localization. When it detects another user in the vincinity (methods: determines the current place through GPS, queries the server, receives list of users that reported the same place recently; does bluetooth scan, sends located bluetooth ids to server, receives list of users in the vincinity logged with these ids; etc.), the smart phone beeps, or vibrates. Presents the user name and the shared interest.

3. User decides to interact (or not) with the other user.
In case he decides not to ignore, the user can trigger some kind of interaction with the other user, like sending a message, a photo/image, inform some kind of gesture he will fo to be identified (wave, stand up, etc.). The interaction can be automatic (play the soccer team anthem, a music from an artist, etc.).

Some more use case scenarios
----------------------------

* Allow queries in the server database, enabling people to locate others with some hashtag, even not being close to then;

* People that work for the same company, or unit, or department can use a tag to identify themselves (eg. #acmecorp, #acmeny). The notification could show their business cards;

* People cheering for the same team going to the stadium could be aware of one another. The anthem of the team could play, on both phones, when they get close;

* Some more useful hashtags could be tough about, like: #electrician, #plumber, #tradebooks, #buyingcar, #single, etc.);

* News related to the hashtag could be automatically delievered to the user.

Obstacles
---------

* Precision of localization technologies: GPS, when in closed environments, has bad precision; the ability to use wifi for localization needs to be checked in more detail;

* Batery: for localization to work, one or more of these technologies needs to be enabled. To use all of them simultaneously, batery consumption is high;

* Possible privacy problems.
